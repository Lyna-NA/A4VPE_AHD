                <span>Dear stakeholders,</span>
                <p>We present this report during one of the most sensitive times in the U.S.- Palestine bilateral
                    relationship, not to mention a time of great transformation in
                    the respective histories of each nation. In the U.S., the administration is consciously turning the
                    economy inward.Palestine’s economy, on the other hand,
                    is nearing collapse due to the direct impact of decades of Israeli military occupation, but also
                    because
                    the U.S. administration seeks to punish Palestinians
                    for rejecting its policies by withholding financial support. The Trump administration has also
                    severed
                    ties with Palestinians—formerly allies— closing the
                    Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) office in Washington, D.C., dismissing its diplomat, moving
                    the
                    U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, and,
                    most dramatically, merging the U.S. Consulate in East Jerusalem (which was established in 1844) with
                    the
                    internationally-disputed relocated U.S.
                    Embassy in Jerusalem.It has also effectively—and ominously—green-lighted the annexation of land by
                    declaring the occupied Golan Heights to be
                    under Israeli sovereignty.</p>
                <p>Despite this crisis, AVPE is more determined than ever to contribute to cooperative
                    Palestinian/Israeli
                    relationships that create hope and a future of freedom
                    and economic independence for Palestinians. We strongly believe that a growing Palestinian economy
                    will
                    make both Palestinians and Israelis more secure.
                </p>
                <p>This report relates AVPE’s strategic redirection based on experience garnered since its founding in
                    2014.
                    The years of 2016, 2017 and 2018 were a
                    period of analyzing what works, doubling down on successful formulas, hiring staff, and emphasizing
                    knowledge transfer.</p>
