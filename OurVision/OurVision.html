                <p>​The Israeli–Palestinian conflict has gone on for more than seven decades. It often seems that a
                    viable and lasting resolution is distant and complex. At Americans
                    for a Vibrant Palestinian Economy (AVPE), we believe economic development cannot—and should not—wait
                    for political change. We believe the effective use of
                    business and economic levers can make life bearable for Palestinians and provide the experience
                    needed to sustain dignified, empowering livelihoods—now
                    and beyond.
                </p>
                <p>Study after study has documented the debilitating constraints imposed on Palestinians that disrupt
                    business and stifle the economy. In the name of security, the
                    Israeli military stalls and blocks the movement of people and goods, interrupts daily life with
                    patrols and violence, and maintains an atmosphere of insecurity that
                    stymies normal planning and investment. Families are then unable to provide for their daily needs
                    and become frustrated and resentful. Their political freedom is
                    also tied to their economic freedom—the right to a prosperous, fulfilling future.

                </p>
                <p>Nevertheless, many Palestinian enterprises have found ways to survive and even thrive. Palestinian
                    business owners, chasing the entrepreneurial dream, show
                    amazing resilience and creativity in trying to overcome the man-made obstacles they face. This is
                    where we come in. By the time Palestinian business people
                    have coped with Israeli constraints and obstacles, they are spent and have little time to handle the
                    usual business challenges that are key to success.</p>

            <span>Our Mission</span>
            <div>
                <p>AVPE seeks to promote the ongoing development of a vibrant and sustainable economy in Palestine by
                    building bridges and supporting the
                    indigenous business community.
                </p>
                <div>
                    <div class="img-container">

                    </div>
                    <div class="quote">

                        <p>" A free, independent and growing Palestinian economy will make the entire region more
                            secure.
                            Every business transaction and job created plants another seed of hope so that Palestinians
                            can
                            constructively engage to build a future of freedom and economic independence. As impediments
                            on the ground lift, these lasting relationships and investments will support vibrant
                            economic
                            expansion.”</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>When Americans do business with Palestinians, their involvement brings not only new technology and
                    markets but also a backbone of support
                    that helps Palestinians to overcome the array of obstacles they face. By learning about Palestine,
                    Americans challenge their own perceptions
                    about the people and the conflict, laying the groundwork for better policies. Through connections to
                    Americans, the Palestinian business
                    community becomes more engaged and less isolated. Palestinian businesses produce numerous goods and
                    products that are ripe for
                    development and scale-up for the vast U.S. market. And Americans and Palestinians working together
                    create hope and a glimpse of
                    economic independence—a future in which Palestinians can compete globally on a level playing field.
